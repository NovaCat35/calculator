# Calculator!
This project recreates a calculator using all the skills learn so far: html, css, js. There were many challenges in figuring out the logic, regex, DOM manipulation but it comes together to be all worthwhile in the end. Come take a look! (https://novacat35.github.io/calculator/)



## Functionality:
- Keyboard support
- Basic math operations
- Backspace, Clear, decimals
